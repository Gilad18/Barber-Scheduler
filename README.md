# Project Title
Local Barber Shop Appointments Scheduler

# Overview
My local barber told me he needs an online appointment scheduler for his clients to book their slots.
The app should let clients quickly book a slot based on availability and Admin access to view and modify all the upcoming schedules.


## Project timeline 

1. Setting up my environment with React and MongoDB Atlas Cluster, then deploy it with Heroku
2. Design the Database structure and scheme with Mongoose
3. Creating the API route and some basic REST methods
4. State Management with Redux (not that needed but I wanted to practice it)
5. UI layout and conssinty approch
6. All the logic for the 3 Step appointment booking: details/date/confirm
7. Building the Admin pages 
8. Admin options : view/delete/edit appointment
9. Close a day for booking by admin
10. Vacation days setting by admin
11. Hebrew holiday sync

## Technologies Used

## Wins and Blockers

I managed to have most of the functionality I wanted for this app to have a great user experience
and beautiful design. The hardcore information is on one file so if I would like to use the app for a different business I will simply modify the utility.js file. Admin has a quick way to view the upcoming schedule and his/her options are very intuitive. However,I would like to make some improvements in performance and to add an SMS verification.
